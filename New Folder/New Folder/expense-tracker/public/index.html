      Note the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above. It gets replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build process.
      You should only reference files within the `public` folder from this HTML file.

      Unlike using "/favicon.ico" or just "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" is designed to work correctly with both client-side routing and non-root public URLs.
      To configure a non-root public URL, you can use the following commands: `npm run build`.
